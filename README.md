1. Leverage your implementation of quicksort to implement the ith order statistic. Demonstrate it's working via an example. Upload your code to github.

2. Implement and upload your source code to github for: stack, queue, and singly linked list. Make sure to implement the same functionality (api/interface) as the ones from the book.  *Restriction*: Use fixed sized arrays (C style arrays) and assume only integers (C style int) for the data to store.
